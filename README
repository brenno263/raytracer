run.sh should compile and build, then run the executable to produce out.ppm.
anim.sh takes a parameter, which is number of frames to render, and spits out numbered images with the blue dielectric sphere animated.

I'm pretty happy with dielectrics, and I had movable camera working in hw2, so this homework was less difficult for me.

I also went ahead and implemented multithreading. Both scripts set it to use 8 threads.
If you need to adjust, the executable is in src/ray, usage is ./ray <filename>. An available option is --cores=<num_threads>.

Hopefully pretty straightforward to grade.
